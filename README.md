## `whoami`
ðŸ‘‹Nice to meet youðŸ‘‹ 

I am Songlin, a MPhil student supervised by [Prof. Chenshu Wu](https://cswu.me) and [Prof. Chuan Wu](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~cwu/) at [HKU AIoT Lab](https://aiot.hku.hk).

Prior to MPhil, I received my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science with First Class Honours from HKU.

## `cat /proc/research`
My research interest spans across GPU-Related Operating and Networking System. 

Recently I am particularly interested in intra-gpu-kernel level observation and optimization. 

Please check my recent work [Neutrino](https://github.com/neutrino-gpu/neutrino) (ðŸ¥³to appear in OSDI'25 and my first accepted paperðŸ¥³) for more details!

## `cat /proc/industry`
Previously I interned at:
1. [MIHOYO](https://www.mihoyo.com) as Research Intern from Jul 2023 to Aug 2023.
2. [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com) as Machine Learning Platform Architect Intern from Jun 2022 to Aug 2022.

## `cat /proc/teaching`
Personally I loved teaching a lot! 
I was glad to serve as a tutor for [COMP3230 Principles of Operating Systems](https://github.com/aiot-lab/HKU-COMP3230A-Tutorialabs) in Fall 23 and Fall 24, and propose two liked assignments:
* Implement a LLM Chatbot Interface
* Accelerate LLM Inference using Multi-Threading

## `more`
* I am professional in three programming language: Python, C, and Assembly.
* I personally view paper is an advanced and innovative tutorial to reviewers, and score depends on how much they learned.
